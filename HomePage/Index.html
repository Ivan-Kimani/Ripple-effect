I met Sandra (to me Wanjiku) when my life has been turned upside down and everything was painted a very venomous black. Lost my income during covid 19 season which threw me in total dependence on my husband and that did not go well as he lost his job 6 months later.
She played and prayed a very major role in my turn around. I was slowly sinking into depression and life was slowly turning useless. God used her to paint the brick picture into a colored mirage and I slowly turned from a low self esteem to believing myself all over again and regaining my self worth.
Wanjiku to me is a combination of so many things. A prayer warrior, a no nonsense girl who gives you as it is, very honest and yet able to connect emotionally with a lot of people. That's Wanjiku to me.

                    To start off, I met Sandra back in 2016 when she moved into our apartment block. After a while, we met and introduced ourselves and henceforth became good friends.
One afternoon, Sandra invited me over for a cup of tea in her house. We started talking about life issues and the things that ail us, it is then that I realized that she has this innate ability to just listen deeply and mirror back what you are saying…
She spoke to my inner child and she also helped me become vulnerable with myself and accept who I am. I love the fact that she is not judgemental and she is genuinely concerned with my progress as a person. She is out to help me live a wholesome life as a mum and as a woman and I am very grateful for the input she has had in my life.

                    To start off, I met Sandra back in 2016 when she moved into our apartment block. After a while, we met and introduced ourselves and henceforth became good friends. Our children at that time were still very young and they also were good friends.
                    One afternoon, Sandra invited me over for a cup of tea in her house and of course we got to talking about life issues and the things that ail us, it is then that I realized that she has this innate ability to just listen deeply and mirror back what you are saying… This was very reflective and what I noted after having a few tea times together, my life was improving because our talks were helping me understand my life much better.
